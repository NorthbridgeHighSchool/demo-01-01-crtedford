  <h1>My favorite thing to do is read</h1>
  <h1>I have many books!</h1>
 <p>I love to read and I enjoy it so much. I have a new bookshelf I get to decorate my room with! That makes me very excited.I find it so relaxing to read, but it takes up so much time. I find it hard to make time to sit down and read most days. Other important things occupy my time.</p>
 <p>My sister hates reading, she says she doesn't have the attention span for it. Apparently, I have a lot of patience! My partner also hates reading, he says he can't understabd how I can stay in one place for hours and just read.</p>
 <p> My favorite seris right now has to be Harry Potter. Although, I really love Leigh Bardugo. I have many different kinds of genres in my book collection. My main interest is in history, so I love books that take place in the past. And fantasy books! :)
